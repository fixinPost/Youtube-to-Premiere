run 'MasterInstall' to download all thirdparty software. 
if master install doesn't work, run 'installBrew', 'installFfmpeg', and 'install youtube-dl' in that order.
to run the script without a debug env donwload jsx launcher (compatible with premiere pro 2019 v.13 -2020 v.14)

this script doesnt work in the most current version of premiere pro, because Premiere Pro seems to have partially broken the scripting api in the newest update. I get an 'illegal arguments' error with simple code that has always worked before.
it is only confirmed to work with version 14.0, but it likely works with older premiere 2019, also known as v.13. Don't blame me if you use 14.4 or whatever, Adobe broke it, I can't even query the premiere pro api in the new version, it's almost completely broken :((((((((

download my github files, launch jsx launcher from the Window > Extensions, select my script folder with jsx launcher, and if you've installed all thirdpary software succesffuly, you should be good to go.
