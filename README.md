download my github files, launch jsx launcher from the Window > Extensions, select my script folder with jsx launcher, and if you've installed all thirdpary software succesffuly, you should be good to go. 

If you use an olddddd version of premiere that's incompatible with jsx launcher, message me on my youtube channel, that'll incentivise me to turn this into a real plugin, compatible with older PP versions.
